**A package for 3D cell segmentation with deep learning, including a napari plugin**: training, inference, and data review. In particular, this project was developed for analysis of confocal and mesoSPIM-acquired (cleared tissue + lightsheet) tissue datasets, but is not limited to this type of data. [Check out our preprint for more information!](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.17.594691v1)

## Installation

 💻 See the [Installation page](https://adaptivemotorcontrollab.github.io/CellSeg3D/welcome.html) in the documentation for detailed instructions.

## Documentation

📚 Documentation is available at [https://AdaptiveMotorControlLab.github.io/CellSeg3D](https://adaptivemotorcontrollab.github.io/CellSeg3D/welcome.html)

📚 For additional examples and how to reproduce our paper figures, see: [https://github.com/C-Achard/cellseg3d-figures](https://github.com/C-Achard/cellseg3d-figures)

## Quick Start

```
pip install napari_cellseg3d
```

To use the plugin, please run:
```
napari
```
Then go into `Plugins > napari_cellseg3d`, and choose which tool to use.

- **Review (label)**: This module allows you to review your labels, from predictions or manual labeling, and correct them if needed. It then saves the status of each file in a csv, for easier monitoring.
- **Inference**: This module allows you to use pre-trained segmentation algorithms on volumes to automatically label cells and compute statistics.
- **Train**:  This module allows you to train segmentation algorithms from labeled volumes.
- **Utilities**: This module allows you to perform several actions like cropping your volumes and labels dynamically, by selecting a fixed size volume and moving it around the image; fragment images into smaller cubes for training; or converting labels from instance to segmentation and the opposite.

## Why use CellSeg3D?

The strength of our approach is we can match supervised model performance with purely self-supervised learning, meaning users don't need to spend (hundreds) of hours on annotation. Here is a quick look of our key results. TL;DR see panel **f**, which shows that with minmal input data we can outperform supervised models:

## Requirements

**Compatible with Python 3.8 to 3.10.**
Requires **[napari]**, **[PyTorch]** and **[MONAI]**.
Compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux.
Installation of the plugin itself should not take more than 30 minutes, depending on your internet connection,
and whether you already have Python and a package manager installed.

For PyTorch, please see [the PyTorch website for installation instructions].

A CUDA-capable GPU is not needed but very strongly recommended, especially for training.

If you get errors from MONAI regarding missing readers, please see [MONAI's optional dependencies] page for instructions on getting the readers required by your images.

Please reach out if you have any issues with the installation, we will be happy to help!

### Install note for ARM64 (Silicon) Mac users

To avoid issues when installing on the ARM64 architecture, please follow these steps.

1) Create a new conda env using the provided conda/napari_CellSeg3D_ARM64.yml file :

        git clone https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CellSeg3d.git
        cd CellSeg3d
        conda env create -f conda/napari_CellSeg3D_ARM64.yml
        conda activate napari_CellSeg3D_ARM64


2) Install a Qt backend (PySide or PyQt5)
3) Launch napari, the plugin should be available in the plugins menu.



## Issues

**Help us make the code better by reporting issues and adding your feature requests!**


If you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.

## Testing

You can generate docs locally by running ``make html`` in the docs/ folder.

Before testing, install all requirements using ``pip install napari-cellseg3d[test]``.

``pydensecrf`` is also required for testing.

To run tests locally:

- Locally : run ``pytest napari_cellseg3d\_tests`` in the plugin folder.
- Locally with coverage : In the plugin folder, run ``coverage run --source=napari_cellseg3d -m pytest`` then ``coverage xml`` to generate a .xml coverage file.
- With tox : run ``tox`` in the plugin folder (will simulate tests with several python and OS configs, requires substantial storage space)

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome.

Please ensure the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.

For local installation from Github cloning, please run:

```
pip install -e .
```

abstract = {Understanding the complex three-dimensional structure of cells is crucial across many disciplines in biology and especially in neuroscience. Here, we introduce a set of models including a 3D transformer (SwinUNetR) and a novel 3D self-supervised learning method (WNet3D) designed to address the inherent complexity of generating 3D ground truth data and quantifying nuclei in 3D volumes. We developed a Python package called CellSeg3D that provides access to these models in Jupyter Notebooks and in a napari GUI plugin. Recognizing the scarcity of high-quality 3D ground truth data, we created a fully human-annotated mesoSPIM dataset to advance evaluation and benchmarking in the field. To assess model performance, we benchmarked our approach across four diverse datasets: the newly developed mesoSPIM dataset, a 3D platynereis-ISH-Nuclei confocal dataset, a separate 3D Platynereis-Nuclei light-sheet dataset, and a challenging and densely packed Mouse-Skull-Nuclei confocal dataset. We demonstrate that our self-supervised model, WNet3D – trained without any ground truth labels – achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art supervised methods, paving the way for broader applications in label-scarce biological contexts.},
